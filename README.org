* Using PWGL for Post-Tonal voice-leading work
** Introduction
This project features several files with the ~.pwgl~ file extension. Technically, these are all files that contain Lisp code, and so can be opened, examined (and ultimately versioned controlled) without using the PWGL application.

However, the rewards for doing so are nil (haha, Lisp jokes). Because of the way PWGL uses CLOS to make a more useful-to-a-musician visual environment, you really want to play with them within PWGL itself.

It is, nevertheless, useful to have plain text (or slightly marked up text) describing what's going on, independent of opening up and running the existing patches and examining the documentation within.
** Reading and Reflecting
Please [[file:Music-7710-essay.org][file:~/repos/CSP-voiceleading/Music-7710-essay.org]] for an essay occasioned by this first substantial project using PWGL.
